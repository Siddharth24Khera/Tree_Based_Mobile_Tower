# Tree_Based_Mobile_Tower
Data Structures : Implemented tree and set data structures to simulate the real world process of mobile tower systems.

Designed a data structure that will help us solve a simplified version of the mobile phone tracking problem, i.e., the
fundamental problem of cellular networks: When a phone is called, find where it is lo cated so that a connection may be established.
Implementing the details of the tracking system through routing map tree class.
